Great work!

Should I assume that since you are using mongo, the "entities" in your ERD
are the "collections" in your mongo database?  If so, you might put a note
in that section stating that as an assumption, when you do the detailed
version.

You did a wonderful job on this document.

Total: 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.
