# OneUp Database Project

### What is OneUp?

OneUp is a web application that aims to create a space where young skateboard talent can surface up democratically, powered by those who know and love skating. The app is centered around a database of user-uploaded skate videos that are curated by upvotes and downvotes from other users. Skaters are constantly aiming to get sponsored while building their personal brand, and Oneup can make this process more efficient. Besides serving the committed skater, anyone who simply enjoys watching skate videos will have a place to watch the top clips and have a say in which video/skater should be noticed.
